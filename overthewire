Bandits Wargame

Level 1 
loginned via bandit0 and bandit0
ls for locating file in the current directory
found readme file
cat readme gave boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1 which is password for next level bandit1

Level 2
ls gave a file named -
we can open it via cat ./- or any other operation with other commands we have to use -- or even we can use cat < -
it gave the password for level bandit2
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9

level 3
upon ls a file is there called
spaces in this filename
yeah literally, so we have to open it we can open it by using "" or ' '
or use \ between the every spaced letter
so after cat "spaces in this filename", it gave
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK for bandit3

Level 4
we got a directory named in here upon ls
cd inhere and ls gave nothing but since the level suggested it has a hidden filename
ls -la gave .hidden file
cat .hidden gave 
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB for bandit4

level 5
upon ls gave inhere directory, on cd to it, it gave 9 files with -file00 to 09 series
cat on first file gave bizzare output, since the intro to level gave that the password is in a human readable
so we can either check each of them and clearing our screen if it messed up but there is also a better way
file is a command which can be used for seeing file type, now we have to list all the files with type in single command
file * gave error as the name starts with - so we have to do
file -- *
which will list all the types
-file00: data
-file01: data
-file02: data
-file03: data
-file04: data
-file05: data
-file06: data
-file07: ASCII text
-file08: data
-file09: data
here file 7 is readable which gave
koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh for bandit5

level 6
the guide says the file has these properties:
human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable
upon ls, a directory inhere with many subdirectories maybeinhere found, which further contained many other files with spaced, dot, - names in naming
we can use ls * -lh and analyze the file size nearest 1.(something)K but we have to do this manaully, so I found find command with -size parameter will
shorten our search process, I simply searched
find ./ -size 1033c (c for bytes)
which gave
./maybehere07/.file2
upon file on it, it gave 
./maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines
cat gives 
DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7 with long spaces, tried for bandit6 and it worked :)
